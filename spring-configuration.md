### 1) What is a configuration file?

**Simple Explanation:**
A configuration file is like a recipe book for Spring. It contains instructions for the Spring framework, telling it how to create and manage beans (objects) in your application.

**Answer to Interviewer:**
"A configuration file in Spring is like a recipe book. It provides instructions to the Spring framework on how to create and manage beans in our application."

### 2) How is configuration metadata provided to the Spring container/ how are beans configured in the Spring container?

**Simple Explanation:**
Configuring beans is like setting up a playground. You can do it either by writing instructions in an XML file or by adding notes directly in the code using annotations. Spring reads these instructions and sets up the playground accordingly.

**Answer to Interviewer:**

### 3) What is the difference between XML and Annotation configuration?

**Simple Explanation:**
XML is like writing a letter with formal instructions, while annotations are like leaving sticky notes around the house. XML provides a separate file for configuration, while annotations allow you to embed instructions directly in the code.

**Answer to Interviewer:**
"The difference between XML and Annotation configuration is like writing a formal letter (XML) versus leaving sticky notes (annotations). XML provides a separate file for configuration, while annotations allow you to embed instructions directly in the code."

### 4) How is annotation-based configuration enabled in Spring?

**Simple Explanation:**
Enabling annotation-based configuration is like saying, "Let's use sticky notes!" You add `@Configuration` to a class, telling Spring to look for annotations in that class for bean configuration.

**Answer to Interviewer:**
"Enabling annotation-based configuration in Spring is like saying, 'Let's use sticky notes!' You add `@Configuration` to a class, signaling to Spring to look for annotations in that class for bean configuration."

### 5) Can there be multiple configuration files in a project?

**Simple Explanation:**
Having multiple configuration files is like having different chapters in a recipe book. Each file can focus on a specific part of the application, making it more organized and manageable.

**Answer to Interviewer:**
"Yes, there can be multiple configuration files in a project. It's like having different chapters in a recipe book. Each file can focus on a specific part of the application, making it more organized and manageable."
